              Hello! I'm Nik Bishop, a passionate developer with expertise in
              creating innovative web solutions. With a keen eye for detail and
              a love for clean code, I strive to build user-friendly and
              efficient applications.

              <h3>Rainy Days</h3>
              <p>
                This project evolved through two distinct course assignments:
                HTML & CSS and JavaScript 1. Initially, I created a fully
                responsive and accessible website for the HTML & CSS course. In
                the JavaScript 1 course, I expanded the project by integrating
                live product data from the Rainy Days API, transforming it into
                an interactive online store.

              <h3>Community Science Museum</h3>
              <p>
                The Community Science Museum website was crafted to specifically
                cater to its audience of children aged 7-15 and families with
                younger kids. It offers a sleek, accessible, and fully
                responsive design, providing essential details about the museum,
                its exhibits, and opportunities for visitor participation. The
                siteâ€™s primary goal is to spark interest and encourage people to
                visit by offering visually engaging and informative content.
              </p>

              <h3>Fork & Focus</h3>
              <p>
                This project is a culmination of my work during the first year
                of the Front-end Development program at Noroff (FED1). As part
                of the project, I was tasked with building a front-end user
                interface for an existing API-based blogging platform. The
                client requested a responsive application that allows users to
                easily browse dynamic blog content. Additionally, admin features
                were implemented, enabling user registration, login, and blog
                post management.
              </p>
